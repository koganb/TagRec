## Towards A Standardized Tag Recommender Benchmarking Framework

TagRec won the best poster award @ Hypertext 2014 (HT'14) conference: [http://ht.acm.org/ht2014/index.php?awards.poster](http://ht.acm.org/ht2014/index.php?awards.poster)

## Description
The aim of this [work](http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/ht241-kowald.pdf) (please [cite](https://github.com/learning-layers/TagRec/#citation)) is to provide the community with a simple to use, generic tag-recommender framework written in Java to evaluate novel tag-recommender algorithms with a set of well-known std. IR metrics such as nDCG, MAP, MRR, Precision (P@k), Recall (R@k), F1-score (F1@k), Diversity (D), Serendipity (S), User Coverage (UC) and folksonomy datasets such as BibSonomy, CiteULike, LastFM, Flickr, MovieLens or Delicious and to benchmark the developed approaches against state-of-the-art tag-recommender algorithms such as MP, MP_r, MP_u, MP_u,r, CF, APR, FR, GIRP, GIRPTM, etc.

Furthermore, it contains algorithms to process datasets (e.g., p-core pruning, leave-one-out or 80/20 splitting, LDA topic creation and create input files for other recommender frameworks).

The software already contains four novel tag-recommender approaches based on cognitive science theory. The first one ([3Layers](http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/cikm2013.pdf)) (Seitlinger et al, 2013) uses topic information and is based on the ALCOVE/MINERVA2 theories (Krutschke, 1992; Hintzman, 1984). The second one ([BLL+C](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2580000/2576934/p463-kowald.pdf)) (Kowald et al., 2014b) uses time information is based on the ACT-R theory (Anderson et al., 2004). The third one ([3LT](http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/msm8_kowald.pdf)) (Kowald et al., 2015b) is a combination of the former two approaches and integrates the time component on the level of tags and topics. Finally, the fourth one ([BLLac+MPr](http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/msm7_kowald.pdf)) extends the BLL+C algorithm with semantic correlations (Kowald et al., 2015a).

Apart from this, TagRec also contains algorithms for the personalized recommendation of resources / items in social tagging systems. In this respect TagRec includes a novel algorithm called [CIRTT](http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/sp2014.pdf) (Lacic et al., 2014) that integrates tag and time information using the BLL-equation coming from the ACT-R theory (Anderson et al, 2004). Furthermore, it contains another novel item-recommender called [SUSTAIN+CFu](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.07716v1.pdf) (Seitlinger et al., 2015) that improves user-based CF via integrating the addentional focus of users via the SUSTAIN model (Love et al., 2004).

Finally, TagRec was also utilized for the recommendation of hashtags in Twitter (Kowald et al., 2017). Thus, it contains an initial set of algorithms for this task as well. For this, TagRec also contains a connection to the Apache Solr search engine framework.

## Download
The source-code can be directly checked-out through this repository. It contains an Eclipse project to edit and build it and an already deployed .jar file for direct execution. Furthermore, the folder structure that is provided in the repository is needed, where _csv_ is the input directory and _metrics_ is the output directory in the _data_ folder. Both of these directories contain subdirectories for the different datasets:
